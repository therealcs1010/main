== Introduction

AlgoSenpai Adventures (ASA) is for students taking CS2040 or any similar data structures and algorithms module who
want to reinforce their understanding of the topics in a fast and engaging way, rather than through rote memorisation.
More importantly, ASA is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having
the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ASA can be a more time-efficient solution to
practice your understanding as compared to VisuAlgo (which uses clicking). Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to
get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `AlgoSenpaiAdventures.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for the application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  A `UserData.txt` file will be automatically created in the folder of the application the first
time you start it.

from time to time. +
Format : `save`


== FAQ

*Q*: Does my game auto-save for me or do I have to manually save it?  +
*A*: The game will try to save an instance for you automatically after certain checkpoints. However, in some unforeseen circumstances, the program might terminate midway, causing your progress to not be saved. As such, we recommend users to do a manual save occasionally as well.

*Q*: How do I maximise my learning potential with the report that I have generated?   +
*A*: The report generated will give a good indication on the chapters that you are weak at, based on the time taken to solve the questions, as well as the number of question you gotten correct. As such, more effort can be placed into practicing the chapters which are deemed “weak” by the reports as it indicates a lack of conceptual understanding.

*Q*: Is there a time limit to the questions given? +
*A*: There is no time limit for each question currently. Users are expected to improve with more practice and as such they should be able to answer questions within the stipulated time. Questions at the beginning are generally given more time than questions towards the ending of the chapter.

*Q*: I made an accidental mistake in my answer for the previous question. Is there a way for me to undo it? +
*A*: Yes. You can enter the command `back` to redo the last question.

*Q*: What is the difference between `undo` and `back`?  +
*A*:`undo` will reverse the decision made by the user while `back` simply returns to the previous question. `undo` will not reverse any answer input given by the user, but rather any other console commands given.

*Q*: How can I keep a copy of the questions?  +
*A*: You can either archive the questions in the game with the command `archive` or print the questions into PDF with the command `print`. 

*Q*: Will the questions in each quiz be repeated?   +
*A*: Each question will be phrased the same; however, the list of numbers for the question are randomly generated.

*Q*: Can I challenge friends in a multiplayer mode?   +
*A*: Unfortunately, you can’t. However, you still can share your scores with your friends through email.

*Q*: Are there automatic software updates?    +
*A*: There is no automatic software updates. To get the updates, you need to redownload the latest version of the software.
