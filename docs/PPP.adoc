== Overview :

About the project : Our team was tasked to morph a basic command line interface desktop application into another product
for our Software Engineering project. We decided to turn it into an edutainment product. Programming has solidified itself
as a core pillar of education and our team aspires to improve every students’ understanding on programming. Our product
incorporates the advantages of many resources already available to the public to develop our users’ understanding of
data structures and algorithms, which is an undeniable fundamental in programming.

There are several features users can use to optimise their learning, such as the Lecture mode, Quiz mode and Arcade mode,
and the product was designed to cater to users with different levels of proficiencies.

== Summary of Contributions :

=== Contributions to the software

My largest contribution to the project was the implementation of the critical features as well as the backend code of the
application.

==== Implementation of the critical features.

.. Lecture Mode +
* The lecture mode was a proposed feature by me in order to assist students who are not proficient at Data Structures
and Algorithms and require some assistance. This feature was inspired by https://visualgo.net[VisuAlgo] and the resources
used for the lecture slides were taken from reputable sources such as https://geeksforgeeks.org[GeeksforGeeks]. +

.. Arcade Mode +
* The Arcade mode was another proposed feature by me in order to improve students who are already confident in their skills
in Data Structures and Algorithms and want to test themselves. Questions will continuously be generated until users get a
wrong answer. By incorporating this challenging feature, users will feel motivated to improve. This feature was inspired by
games such as https://flappybird.io/[Flappy Bird], where users continuously try to beat their high score.

==== Backend code of the application.

.. Quiz generation +
* I was also responsible for the database behind the critical features of the application. My duty was to ensure the
correctness of the questions that were generated. The questions generated were inspired by https://visualgo.net[VisuAlgo's Quiz],
but the source code for generation was mostly written by me, with some referenced from https://geeksforgeeks.org[GeeksforGeeks].
* Each chapter contained approximately 4 different types of questions. However, the parameters supplied to each question type
are randomly generated which makes it very unlikely that students will encounter the same question.
* Here is a reference to the https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-3/main/tree/master/src/main/java/com/algosenpai/app/logic/chapters[source code].

.. Review generation +
* The review command was primarily for weak users who  wish to understand what went wrong in the quiz. This was also inspired by https://visualgo.net[VisuAlgo's Quiz],
as they did not provide any help if users got the question wrong. The steps given in the review feature were
written by me.
* Each question contains a comprehensive method on how to solve it, using a step-by-step methodological approach.
* Here is a reference to one of the question's review https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/com/algosenpai/app/logic/chapters/chapter1/BubbleSortPassesQuestion.java[source code].

.. Menu generation +
* The menu command serves as a quick guide for new users to check on the syntax of various commands. This command was implemented
by my team member, but was improved on by me.
* Previously, each command was listed out, but I improved on it by partitioning the different commands into their separate
categories. This improved the overall user experience. I also refactored the code to read in commands from a text file to
minimise legacy issues.
* Here is a reference to the source code for https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/com/algosenpai/app/logic/command/utility/MenuCommand.java[`MenuCommand.java`].
